Welcome to my repository! This is a space where I will continuously practice, refine, and update solutions related to the Next.js framework. Youâ€™ll find various implementations, optimizations, and example projects as I explore different features of Next.js, including SSR, API routes, static generation, dynamic routing, and more.

I aim to make this a comprehensive and evolving reference for anyone looking to dive into the intricacies of Next.js.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or provide feedback!
